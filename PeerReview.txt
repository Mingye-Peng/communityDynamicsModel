Summary for Biocomputing Final Project Peer-Review:
Reviewers: Brittni Bertolet, Josh Hobgood, and Aaron Long

Major summary: It seems like you're using the notebook summary as a checklist and sourcing out to other files to provide information for what you did. It might be more helpful to put the information here, so the reader doesn't need to look at other files, unless they would like to recreate your analysis. Because Jupyter Notebook is interactive and can utilize code, this is possible and would really enhance your project. 

Notes on BLAST: 
- The summary of files for the BLAST analysis that you listed in your notebook summary was really helpful. It might be helpful to also include the "head" of the final table, so that the reader can see and understand the data real fast. 


Notes on Translation of RNA seq data:
- What does the codonmap.txt data look like? 
- It would be helpful to have more pseudo code in the for loop. We were still a little confused. 
- For closing files, is the syntax "control1.close" or "control1.close()"? We weren't sure about this.

Notes on Further Exploration:
- Could you summarize the objectives a little more?
