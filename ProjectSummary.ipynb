    "The first equation is broken up into two parts. The first describes the prey as a single population. The b value represents the natural population increase (a rate that considers births and deaths in an unrestricted environment) of the population. The term in parentheses represents constraints on the population due to resources, where α represents 1/k where  k is the carrying capacity."
